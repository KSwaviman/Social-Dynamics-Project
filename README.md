# Exploring the Impact of Context and Personality on Student Mood: A machine Learning Approach

***Abstract*** - This study aims at understanding the relation between various factors and a
student's mood and how their personality traits affect this relation.Data used for this study
was collected through a smartphone app called i-Log, using questionnaires as well as
smartphone sensors. A GPS sensor was used in this case. Data was collected over a month
period The datasets were cleaned, pre-processed and merged together to form a master
dataset. Statistical tests were performed to check if there exists any difference between the
mood over weekdays and over weekends and also between students of various personalities.
Machine Learning methods such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting were used to
predict mood. Results showed that the most contributing predictors were varying based on
personalities of the students and the time of the week. These findings provide insights into
how contextual factors, sensor data and personality differences interact to shape a
student's mood.

# Description:

Online data collection methods have transformed research methodologies. Through
smartphone apps a larger and diverse population can be reached in order to collect data anytime
anywhere which has never been possible through traditional methods. One such application is
i-Log which researchers at the University of Trento have developed in order to collect data
through questionnaires as well as mobile sensors. Our study made use of the data collected
through i-Log application over a month period between November 2022 and December 2022.
Data was collected by asking student participants contextual questions like where they are at the
moment, who they are with, what they were doing at that moment and how they feel (mood).
Simultaneously the app sends sensor data such as light sensors, proximity, gyro, gps coordinates
and so on. Certain socio-demographic and personality trait information was collected from
participants in the beginning such as, which department they study in, what degree they are
enrolled in, nationality and region they live in and estimations were also made on where they
stand in terms of big five personality traits. For my specific study I made use of the gps sensor
data along with other datasets mentioned above. The purpose was to study the mood of
respondents, what are the predictors of the mood among students with different personality types
and how do these predictors vary between different time diaries.

# Final Thoughts:
The project aimed to understand the relationship between mood and various predictors in
the students of University of Trento. Through Exploratory Data Analysis, several insights
were gained on the impact of the environment on mood. For example one insight was that,
the law students exhibit relatively lower levels of happiness when they are with their
partners. Time of the day, specified as hour, day of the week and level of conscientiousness
were found to be some of the most important factors across all groups of students.
Additionally the day type was also found to play a significant role in the variation of mood,
with distinction made between weekdays and weekends. These findings highlight the
importance of considering personality traits as well as contexts in which students experience
their mood and provide valuable insights for future research in this area. Use of sensor data
has been instrumental in this research as such data have the least chances of error as
compared to self reported data. Ultimately, this work has the potential to inform educational
policies and strategies aimed at promoting the well-being of university students.
